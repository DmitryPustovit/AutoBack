AutoBack
========
AutoBack was created to make sure that a developer or an average computer user never looses their files.
This is done by creating hotkeys such as Ctrl S which is the default save hot key and asignign it to
automatically backup a selected folder.


Tech Specs
==========
Written in C# using the .net framework. 
Originally writes in Visual Studios 2012 Express. 


Update
======
I wont be working on this project for a while. To much to do and the original excitement I had about this project
is gone.  


KNOWN BUGS
==========
Ironically when you run it, it binds the ctrl S to AutoBack. However, the hot key no longer works in any other
program. This defeats the purpose.
	-- I have an idea on how to fix this. I just haven't had the time to implement it.
