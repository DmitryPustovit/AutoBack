AutoBack
========
AutoBack was created to make sure that a developer or an average computer user never looses their files.
This is done by creating hotkeys such as Ctrl S which is the default save hot key and asignign it to
automatically backup a selected folder.


Tech Specs
==========
Written in C# using the .net framework. 
Originally writen in Visual Studios 2013 Express. 


Update
======
I wont be working on this project for a while. To much to do and the original excitement I had about this project
is gone.  

I fixed the program so it functions as intended. I will make a web page for the project eventually. I have quite a few ideas for this project
some I may release later on. 


KNOWN BUGS
==========
None know at this moment.
