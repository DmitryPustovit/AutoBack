OUTDATED
========
This application has is now included as a plugin in a new project that I am developing. As such the source code has been removed and an updated plugin version will be posted along with the new project.






AutoBack
========
AutoBack was created to make sure that a developer or an average computer user never looses their files.
This is done by creating hotkeys such as Ctrl S which is the default save hot key and assigning it to
automatically backup a selected folder.


Tech Specs
==========
Written in C# using the .net framework. 
Originally written in Visual Studios 2013 Express. 


Update
======
I wont be working on this project for a while. To much to do and the original excitement I had about this project
is gone.  

I fixed the program so it functions as intended. I will make a web page for the project eventually. I have quite a few ideas for this project
some I may release later on. 


KNOWN BUGS
==========
- This issue appears to have been fixed. The code seems to still not be optimized as much as it could be.(It sometimes takes two times to save in another program. This is an issues caused by some inefficient code.)
